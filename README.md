# Virtual-Valor
A VR fighting game built by Edu Argumedo

- Introduction
  This project was undertaken because I have a passion for creating games and I wanted to challenge myself with VR. My original idea was going to be a basic game you play with keyboard and mouse, but when I took the VR Lab class at Grand Canyon University, I decided it would be an interesting challenge to develop in VR. This will allow me to grow much more than making a basic game as well as prove that I can put in the effort to learn new technologies to accomplish a goal. Leaning into VR also adds more possibilities for my career to go into since VR is growing at a fast pace.

  * Player should be able to kill enemies quickly
  * All aspects of the game should be easily accesible
  * All inputs shoul respond quickly
  
- Technologies used:
  * Unity 2022.3.7f1: Unity was chosen since I had some basic knowledge about it as well as it being the most popular indie game engine. This meant that it was somewhat simple to learn and had a lot of support for any issues I may have run into while making my project.
  * Visual Studio 2022 version 17.7.4: Visual Studio is able to be implemented with Unity making it a great choice for a code editor. I also had previos experience from my C# classes with Visual Studio.
  * XR Interaction Toolkit 2.4.3: This was the plugin I was introduced to when taking the VR lab class, therefore giving me some basic knowledge on how to use it. It was also made for Unity so it worked very well with Unity.
  * XR Plugin Management 4.4.0: This plugin simply managed the XR Interaction Toolkit and is required for it's functionality.
  * Plastic SCM 11.0.16.8204: Plastic is similar to github but it is made specifically for Unity. This intergration allowed ease of use as well as great functionality for version control
    
- What technologies were new
  * I knew the basicas of how to use Unity, but there were many new methods and syntax I had to learn to do advanced movements
  * The XR Interaction Toolkit, XR Plugin Management, and Plastic SCM were all relatively new to me due to only using it for a semester for the VR lab class and only going over the basics. This project widened my scope of how I can use all of these technologies.
  
- Technical Approach
  * In this project, I will be creating a game in VR to challenge myself and learn how to make a good gameplay experience even when the graphics aren’t phenomenal. The main objective is to make a fully fleshed out basic game with realistic physics along with a rewarding gameplay loop to be able to expand upon with out-of-scope features. These out-of-scope features are a leaderboard and multiplayer. I would like to be able to implement a leaderboard to have players compete against each other across the world. This would build a community between the players to push each other to break each other’s high scores. Although this would be nice to have, due to time constraints this will be out of scope along with multiplayer. I wanted to implement multiplayer to encourage players to play against each other and open the possibility of a co-operative leaderboard as well. I have not used the Unity Network manager so this would come with a huge risk leading me to decide that this feature would be out of scope. 

- Risks/Challenges
  * Time Constraint: Most games take years to make while I had 1 year
  * Solo Development: Most games also have a team working on them but I was a solo developer learning and doing everything to bring the project together
  * Learning New Content:This was an interesting challenge because it tested how well I could learn and retain different functionalities of Unity and the plugins I was using
  * Applying Learned Content properly: I had never tried doing object tracking or collision detection before so learning and applying the knowledge I was gaining was a matter of trial and error
  * Missing Assets: This was a low probability risk where the Unity Asset Store may not have an asset I'm looking for. I was fortunate enough to find everything I needed or be able to change my approach.

- Issues/Bugs
  * Game is not fully animated
  * Shop doesn't have full functionality yet
